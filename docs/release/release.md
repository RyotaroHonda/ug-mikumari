# Release notes

## Version 1.1 - Dec. 13, 2023

### New + Improved

- Add pwrOnRst port to CbtLane
  - CbtLane has single reset input so far despite using several clock signals. Logics driven by clkPar and logics driven by clkIndep and clkIdelayRef should not be reset by the same reset signal. To fix this, another reset signal, pwrOnRst, is introduced; it is expected that this reset is generated by the PLL lock signal, which generates clkIndep and clkIdelayRef signals.
